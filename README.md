This image shows the dot map for the accidents Severity wise and gives the required data throuhout Karnataka.

## AI-Bot
We have created an AI Bot that would give us informatio on the dataset provided and answer the required queries regarding the accidents.
The Bot is in its Beta version.

To access the Bot we can see it on the wesite at the bottom right corner on every page of the site.
